                    <p>This site outlines and defines elements of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ecosystem-of-trust-evaluation-report-2023">Ecosystem of Trust<link> and provides a reference for those working with UK Government, third party trade associations and experts, industry and other jurisdictions to co-design, deliver and operationalise elements of it.</p>
                    <p>EoT stage 1 was the result of a large amount of collaborative work with many contributions made particularly by the private sector (EoT consortia), it ended March 2023 and included the publication of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ecosystem-of-trust-evaluation-report-2023">report</a> which inludes an evaluation and recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Stage two is now in progress and will deliver on the recommendations within the evaluation report with UK Government, industry and other jurisdictions working together on a number of Border Trade Demonstrators (BTDs).</p>
                    <p>You can find links here to the Border Trade Demonstrator repository, Interop Working Group and Signals repositories.</p>
                    <h2>Getting started</h2>
                    <p>
                        Design, implementation, delivery, operationalisation and evaluation of the recommendations (and ongoing research) will be undertaken through a number of <a href="https://github.com/border-trade-demonstrators">Border Trade Demonstrators</a>.
