# The Ecosystem of Trust

This site outlines and defines elements of the [Ecosystem of Trust](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ecosystem-of-trust-evaluation-report-2023) and provides a reference for those working with UK Government, third party trade associations and experts, industry and other jurisdictions to co-design, deliver and operationalise elements of it.

EoT stage 1 was the result of a large amount of collaborative work with many contributions made particularly by the private sector (EoT consortia), it ended March 2023 and included the publication of a [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ecosystem-of-trust-evaluation-report-2023) which inludes an evaluation and recommendations.

Stage two is now in progress and will deliver on the recommendations within the evaluation report with UK Government, industry and other jurisdictions working together on a number of Border Trade Demonstrators (BTDs).

You can find links here to the Border Trade Demonstrator repository, Interop Working Group and Signals repositories.

## Getting Started

Design, implementation, delivery, operationalisation and evaluation of the recommendations (and ongoing research) will be undertaken through a number of [Border Trade Demonstrators](https://github.com/border-trade-demonstrators).
